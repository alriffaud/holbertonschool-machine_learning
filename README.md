Passionate about technology, especially in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, I seek to contribute to the development of innovative solutions. My training and experience as a mathematics and physics teacher for 25 years have provided me with analytical skills, problem-solving and effective communication, complemented by my participation in development teams and extensive knowledge of programming languages ​​such as Python and C. I am a persevering person, responsible and oriented towards self-learning, always seeking efficiency and clarity in the code. I am looking to enter the IT world as a programmer or data analyst and, in the long term, specialize in machine learning to apply it in the financial sector.
